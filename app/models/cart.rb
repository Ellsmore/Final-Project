class Cart < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :line_items, :dependent => :destroy # ':dependent => :destroy' indicates that the existence of line items is dependent on the existence of the cart i.e. When we delete a cart from the DB we want to delete any associated line items also

    current_item = line_items.find_by_product_id(product_id)

    # find_by_product_id is a dynamic finder contstructed by Active Record
